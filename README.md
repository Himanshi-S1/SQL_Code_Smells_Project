# SQL_Code_Smells_Project
This project investigates the prevalence of SQL code smells and their association with the traditional code smells.

We have used ["On the Prevalence, Impact, and Evolution of SQL Code Smells in Data-Intensive Systems"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3379597.3387467) research paper and have done the implementation as given in this research paper. We have gone through this research paper and are answering the two main research questions as we have told you earlier.

## RQ1: 
What is the prevalence of SQL code smells across different application domains?

## RQ2:  
Do traditional code smells and SQL code smells co-occur at class level?
